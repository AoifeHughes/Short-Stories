# Short-Stories


This is a personal collection of fiction which I am attempting to write with some lite-software engineering-esk organisational tools. 
For example, KanBan boards, software style templates and of course, git. 

# Notice

This repo was going to be private, but I see no reason for it not to be public. I'd suggest that if you are in anyway curious
about the actual fiction involved then you do not look beyond the stories folder. All non pdf files are likely to contain spoilers or meta thinking
of themes / stories / outlines.
