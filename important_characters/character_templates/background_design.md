# Knives D&D design 

A redditor,
[jimbaby](https://arcaneeye.com/dm-tools-5e/dnd-character-backstory-template/),
suggested the knives idea. I quite like it and think it could be used here to
design good character backgrounds. 

Here, we modify this idea to fit an article of creative writing. 

## Concept

- Knives are anything which can raise the stakes of a character's situation
- The term knives is suggestive of the stabbing in the back which these traits
  encourage 
- A well developed character may have ~7 or so 
  - Minor characters can probably have less. 

##  Examples

- Loved ones 
- Mystery about character's past
- An enemy/rival
- A loyalty/promise/obligation/debt to fulfil
