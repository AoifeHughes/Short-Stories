# Knives D&D design 

A redditor,
[jimbaby](https://arcaneeye.com/dm-tools-5e/dnd-character-backstory-template/),
suggested the knives idea. I quite like it and think it could be used here to
design good character backgrounds. 

Here, we modify this idea to fit an article of creative writing. 

## Concept

- Knives are anything which can raise the stakes of a character's situation
- The term knives is suggestive of the stabbing in the back which these traits
  encourage 
- A well developed character may have ~7 or so 
  - Minor characters can probably have less. 

##  Examples

- Loved ones 
- Mystery about character's past
- An enemy/rival
- A loyalty/promise/obligation/debt to fulfil 

# Essential questions checklist 

- [ ] Why does this character exist? 
  - [ ] Are they _essential_? 
- [ ] Character's motivation i.e., from the character's perspective, not the
  author's. 
- [ ] What is their physical description 
- [ ] Vibe - i.e., how do others' generally perceive this character

# Questions to consider for background development

- [ ] Where is the character from 
- [ ] What is their profession/background knowledge
- [ ] Do they have a vice?
- [ ] What's their weakness / blackmail-able feature? 
- [ ] Ties or attachments
  - [ ] Places 
  - [ ] People 
  - [ ] Groups e.g., religion, faction, guild, family
- Life outlook e.g., positive, depressed, optimistic, realist 
- What do they like/dislike
