# Magic systems
- Magic is a reasonably common occurrence
- Magic is pulled from alternative dimensions 
  - This channelling can be done through deliberate and in-deliberate actions
    - Hand/body movements
      - It is said some wizards can create spells from just their eyelids 
    - Dance (uncommon in the region where these stories are told)
    - Music
      - Some bards take the time to learn magic
      - It's a similar process as to learning instruments
      - Mostly these bards will augment their performances with basic things
        like wind, frost, heat. Some master artists may even transfer emotion
        into audiences
### Why doesn't *every* one use magic?
- They could
- Think juggling in real life
  - Not uncommon, just takes time
- Wizards almost exclusively spend their time trying to understand and make more
  replicable. Essentially they're scientists. 

### How does one learn magic
- Meditation 
- Study
- Intense focus on cause and effects 
- Shown and guided by others.
- Similar timescales to learning an instrument. 

### What can magic do
- Magic is accessed by feeling the threads between dimensions and pulling them
  into reality 
- Most people who bother to learn can make some glitter / sparkles to appear,
  these are just lights pulled from alternative dimensions
- In theory there's no limit. 
- Most who study magic agree that the real limit is mental stamina and physical
  control. 
- More complex spells require multiple components and extra layers from extra
  dimensions. These very quickly over-burden the mind
- e.g., one could make fire from pulling heat from one dimension. Thus a simple
  spell. Or, they could create actual fire by pulling heat, oxygen and a fuel
  source from three separate existances into the current reality and thus
  produce true fire. 
  - This metaphor aligns well with instrumental strings, each playing their own
    song which must be in keeping with each other.
