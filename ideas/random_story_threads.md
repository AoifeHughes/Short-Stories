# Major ideas

- Vampire hunters sent in two groups to hunt a vampire
  - Vampire captures one group
  - Gives them amnesia and sends them to kill other group
  - Fear for what they've done propels them to work for/with their now vampire overlord

- A chaotic version of the "One Ring" 
  - Propels the wielder to do chaotic things
  - More conscious than the rings of power
  - Doesn't have to be a ring
    - Probably more interesting if a tool
    - Maybe a lockpick style device
    - Or a cursed/blessed set of tools by a mad god
      - This would lean into the idea of some kind of insane item generator


# Mini ideas

- A ring which casts paralyse on wearer
  - Essentially, crafter creates this and either uses on themselves and gets
    stuck, or they have it stolen/lost/given to someone else who doesn't know
    what it does
    Another angle could be if you trust someone to help you test and also remove
    the ring after the test
