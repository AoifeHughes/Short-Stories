\chapter*{Prologue} \chaptermark{Prologue}


In the depth of the night I have always felt most comfortable. The stillness and
quietness, but for the sounds of the wind and every so often a creak as a
building adjusts itself, lets me feel like I've some control over my thoughts.
The lack of stimulation allows my mind to breathe, and I can think clearly and
focus on the task at hand. That is at least until \textit{he} ruins it by
opening his mouth. 

\begin{dialogue}
    \item{"Do you think they're out?", Bill wondered aloud. As always he wasted
    words on things so obvious.
    To an external observer this might have seemed like a perfectly innocent and valid
    question. But, Bill and I have been at this a while and all the signs are
    there in front of him, same as me. To ask such a question fills me with
    worries about his competence for this job.}
    \item {"No, the bedroom window is open."}
    \item {"How'd you know that's the bedroom?"}
\end{dialogue}

I knew this would continue until daybreak if I let it. Bill has lived with me
long enough to know that I heard his question and was purposefully ignoring it.
I swear once this is done I'm leaving this city, and not just because of Bill...

Entering into a house whilst the inhabitants are home has its upsides and
downsides. I knew, for instance, that the item we've been asked to procure is
never far from its \textit{current} owner. The downside of course being that
looming danger of being heard, seen, attacked, or any number of horrible things
that someone will do to protect themselves when feeling threatened. I mulled
over the various details of the building as I moved towards the narrow ally off
to the side. I'm certain I would have been thinking more clearly if I wasn't
being stalked by my shadow of a partner.

Normally, we wouldn't take such a specific job as this, but when my fence,
Edith, specifically recommended me I was of course intrigued. Sealing my
interest was the small fortune in gold which was offered. Enough for a new start
and a clean, guiltless break.
