\chapter*{Prologue} \chaptermark{Prologue}


In the depth of the night I have always felt most comfortable. The stillness and
quietness, but for the sounds of the wind and every so often a creak as a
building adjusts itself, lets me feel like I've some control over my thoughts.
The lack of stimulation allows my mind to breathe, and I can think clearly and
focus on the task at hand. That is at least until \textit{he} ruins it by
opening his mouth. 

\begin{dialogue}
    \item{"Do you think they're out?", Bill wondered aloud. As always he wasted
    words on things so obvious.
    To an external observer this might have seemed like a perfectly innocent and valid
    question. But, Bill and I have been at this a while and all the signs are
    there in front of him, same as me. To ask such a question fills me with
    worries about his competence for this job.}
    \item {"No, the bedroom window is open."}
    \item {"How'd you know that's the bedroom?"}
\end{dialogue}

I knew this would continue until daybreak if I let it. Bill has lived with me
long enough to know that I heard his question and was purposefully ignoring it.
I swear once this is done I'm leaving this city, and not just because of Bill...

Entering into a house whilst the inhabitants are home has its upsides and
downsides. I knew, for instance, that the item we've been asked to procure is
never far from its \textit{current} owner. The downside of course being that
looming danger of being heard, seen, attacked, or any number of horrible things
that someone will do to protect themselves when feeling threatened. I mulled
over the various details of the building as I moved towards the narrow alley off
to the side. I'm certain I would have been thinking more clearly if I wasn't
being stalked by my shadow of a partner.

Normally, we wouldn't take such a specific job as this, but when my fence,
Edith, specifically recommended me I was of course intrigued, I assumed that she
had some inkling to my interest in planeweaving. Otherwise, it would be very
bizarre to ask for Bill and me when other, much more experienced and reliable
thieves could have done. Sealing my
interest and quelling my suspicions about the nature of being handed a job
rather than apply (as was the norm), was the small fortune in gold which was the
prize offered by the person(s) making the request. The amount of gold would be enough for a new
start, and a clean, guiltless break. Bill would be giddy enough with his split
that he might not even notice my departure for a few days. I made a point of not
planning past this, whilst I personally had issues with Bill, he didn't make it
this far in life on dumb luck. If I planned, if I left a clue to my next move,
then I'm sure he could have followed if he was so inclined. He was an unknown
and I did not want to find out what he was capable of. Thus, my next move will
be a surprise, even to me. 

But first, Ellen, focus. 

\begin{dialogue}
    \item{"I'm going to go in through the top window. You wait here and watch
    the..." started Bill as he looked for a foothold to begin climbing.}
    \item {"You can't see it from here, but the windows all have metal bars
    across them" I interrupted.
    In all fairness, I have always been our scout for heists. Walking past
    several times in the past week allowed me to notice some things which
    darkness hid.}
    \item{"Oh, right. I'll go in through the front door then." snorted Bill sarcastically.}
    \item{"Look", I pointed to the long, thin, rectangular windows just out of
    reach.
     "They're used for ventilation, and it'll be a squeeze, but I think we both could shimmy through."}
    \item{"Good spot", Bill said as he jumped for the small ledge.}
\end{dialogue}

Swinging his legs up and holding himself alongside the window, he showed why he
was in this line of work. As if having practised this exact manoeuvre a thousand
times he reached into one of his many pockets and drew back his hands now coated
in a tacky substance. Placing his hands on the glass of the window he pulled.
Slowly, steadily, and taking care not to lose his balance on the thin ledge he
pulled the ventilation window open. I couldn't help but smile at this display
of ingenuity. 

Taking a step backwards I took a steadying breath, lunging forward, left foot on
the cobbled stone, I pushed upwards, right foot connecting with the wall and
continuing the momentum I reached for the ledge of the window. Without stopping,
I pulled myself upwards and, just like Bill had done a moment before, I swung my
legs and body upwards and sideways. However, with the window open and Bill
already through and into the house, I passed through and into the darkness of
the ground floor, silently.






% TODO: 
% Sketch the house [x]


% TODO: 
% How do we get into the house?
% How do we get the item?
% How do we get out of the house?
% How do we get the item to the fence?
% How do we get the fence to pay us?
% Some more things from Bill to drive Ellen crazy






%% Move this to a follow up question for Ellen to ask later 
% Still, it  on my mind that I would be singled out for this. Of
% course, I asked Edith why she thought I was the best person for the job. Having
% some suspicions, I was not surprised when she told me that she had heard about
% my personal interest in planeweaving.
