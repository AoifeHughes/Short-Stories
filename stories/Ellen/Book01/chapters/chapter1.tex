\chapter{Chapter One}

Some nights I would lie there in bed next to him, listening to the drone of his
snoring and wonder how he slept so easily. On the odd night I might hear his
breathing change and know he was awake too. During these times I knew he was
thinking, mulling over something. I knew there was no point in asking him or
prodding him to share these thoughts. None of this mattered any more of course.
These past few days, since that horrific night, have been different. He was gone
and yet still lives in my head somehow.
